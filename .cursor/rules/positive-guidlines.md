POSITIVE DIRECTIVES (How you SHOULD write)

Clarity and brevity • Craft sentences that average 10–20 words and focus on a single idea, with the occasional longer sentence.

Active voice and direct verbs • Use active voice 90 % of the time.

Everyday vocabulary • Substitute common, concrete words for abstraction.

Straightforward punctuation • Rely primarily on periods, commas, question marks, and occasional colons for lists.

Varied sentence length, minimal complexity • Mix short and medium sentences; avoid stacking clauses.

Logical flow without buzzwords • Build arguments with plain connectors: 'and', 'but', 'so', 'then'.

Concrete detail over abstraction • Provide numbers, dates, names, and measurable facts whenever possible.

Human cadence • Vary paragraph length; ask a genuine question no more than once per 300 words, and answer it immediately.

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY POSITIVE DIRECTIVE INVALIDATES THE OUTPUT.

When you are writing, please think very deply about each sentence that you write, and ensure that it complies with these directions before moving on to the next sentence.
